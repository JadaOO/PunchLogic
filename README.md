# Hi eBacon developer team, welcome to Jadaâ€™s Repo 

What I Have Done 
1. `Seeds`: All data is placed in the Seeds.js file.
2. `salaryCalculatorService`: Implemented the logic to transfer the data using the salaryCalculatorService  component.
3. `PayrollChart`: Created the PayrollChart  component to render all the data.
4. Styling: Combined Bootstrap and CSS for styling.
   
Future Plans if I have more time, I will:

1. Handle styling for different screen sizes.

2 Write tests for my components.
